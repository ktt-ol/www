Of course, we are always happy to welcome new members who support the association financially through their membership fee. Information regarding that can be found at the [membership](@/about/membership.en.md) page.

We are also happy to accept support in the form of financial or material donations to help us achieve our goals. As we are a registered non-profit organization, donation receipts can of course be issued if required. Please [contact](@/contact.en.md) us about this if you have any questions (a bank statement or similar is usually sufficient proof for the tax office for smaller amounts).

If an online purchase is planned, the association can be supported by visiting the respective store via our partner program links from here. This costs nothing, but the association receives a commission for every purchase made in this way.

# Mailing lists
When we are not talking directly to each other, most communication takes place via [mailing lists](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailingliste). The most important of these is "[Discussion](https://mailman.ktt-ol.de/postorius/lists/diskussion.lists.ktt-ol.de/)". This is public, i.e. anyone can register here and then post.

There are many other mailing lists on specific topics. You can find them [here](https://mailman.ktt-ol.de/postorius/lists/).

# Wiki
You can find our wiki at [https://wiki.kreativitaet-trifft-technik.de/](https://wiki.kreativitaet-trifft-technik.de/). There is also a public area here that anyone can read.

# The plenum
We meet at regular intervals (approx. every 1 1/2 weeks) in the Space for a plenum. This is where important issues are addressed and informal opinions are formed. These meetings are also an ideal time for new visitors to get an impression of the hackspace and its members.
